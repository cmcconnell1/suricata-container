# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.1] - 2025-08-14

### Fixed
- **CircleCI Workspace Conflicts**: Resolved "Concurrent upstream jobs persisted the same file(s) into the workspace" error
  - Removed `suricata.tar` from scan job workspace persistence (scan jobs don't modify the image)
  - Removed `suricata.tar` from security-gate job workspace persistence (security-gate only evaluates results)
  - Updated deployment job dependencies to get `suricata.tar` directly from build jobs
  - Added proper workspace isolation between Napatech and AF_PACKET variants
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated workflow diagrams and descriptions to reflect workspace isolation changes

### Changed
- **Workflow Dependencies**: ECR push and artifacts jobs now depend on both their specific build job AND security-gate
- **Workspace Management**: Improved artifact flow to prevent conflicts between parallel build variants

## [2.1.0] - 2025-08-11

### MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: Napatech Validation Complete

**BREAKTHROUGH**: Successfully resolved all Napatech compilation issues and validated production-ready hardware-accelerated container.

### Added
- **Napatech Hardware Acceleration**: **FULLY VALIDATED** Napatech 3GD driver support

- **Custom Header Integration**: Verified Napatech header with debug markers
- **Production Validation**: Comprehensive build and functionality testing
- **Optimized Container Size**: Reduced from 520MB to 490MB

### Fixed
- **Critical Compilation Errors**:
  - Missing `NT_STATISTICS_READ_CMD_QUERY_V2` constant definition
  - Missing `query_v2` union member in NtStatistics_t structure
  - Missing `stat` structure with rx/drop frames/bytes
- **Header Include Path Issues**: Fixed Suricata source files to use custom header
- **Build System Integration**: Verified header replacement and compilation success

### Validated
